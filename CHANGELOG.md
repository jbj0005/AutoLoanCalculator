# Changelog

## v0.2.1 - 2025-09-06
- Fix: Add/Gov fee buttons no longer submit the form or cause layout shifts in the calculator.
- Fix: Remove duplicate `calcForm` declaration that caused a SyntaxError in some browsers.
- Fix: Ensure `config.js` loads before `app.js` so Supabase initializes and shows Connected.
