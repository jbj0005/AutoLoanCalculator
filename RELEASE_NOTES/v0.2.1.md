# Auto Loan Calculator v0.2.1 — 2025-09-06

Highlights
- Fix: Add/Gov Fee buttons no longer submit the form or cause layout shifts in the calculator.
- Fix: Remove duplicate `calcForm` declaration that caused a SyntaxError in some browsers.
- Fix: Load `config.js` before `app.js` so Supabase initializes correctly and shows “Connected”.

Details
- UI: Fee row Remove buttons are explicitly `type="button"` and handlers call `preventDefault()`.
- UX: The calculator form ignores native submit and simply recomputes values, avoiding reloads.
- Stability: Event listeners are guarded so missing optional elements don’t throw and halt setup.

Upgrade Notes
- No breaking changes. Just pull latest main or update to tag `v0.2.1`.
- GitHub Pages will pick up the new version automatically once deployed.
