# Auto Loan Calculator v0.2.2 â€” 2025-09-06

Highlights
- Final Sale Price shorthand: entering `-7500` or `+500` applies the delta to MSRP of the selected vehicle. `-6%` or `+2.5%` also supported (relative to MSRP).
- Validation: if no vehicle is selected (no MSRP) and a negative number is entered for Final Sale Price, the field is cleared and a warning is shown.
- QoL: Calculator state now persists to localStorage; Clear button to reset; faster fee entry (Enter to advance/add); FL Gov't fee presets dropdown.

Details
- Parsing: `parsePriceExpression` supports signed percent and amount shorthands relative to MSRP.
- UX: `showCalcMessage()` surfaces transient warnings above the calculator.
- Persistence: All inputs and fee rows are saved to `calcStateV1` and restored on load.
- Presets: Adds common Florida DMV fees to the Gov't Fees section via a Presets dropdown.

Upgrade Notes
- No breaking changes. Existing saved values are compatible; new state uses key `calcStateV1`.
