% v0.4.0 — 2025-09-11

## Overview
A big UX pass focused on clarity and mobile entry ergonomics. Adds a dedicated MONTHLY AFFORDABILITY cell, merges APR/TERM into Monthly Payment, shows inline savings near toggles, and streamlines Trade‑in details. Inputs are now flex-resizable with standardized placeholders, and Enter/Return advances reliably on mobile.

## Highlights
- New “MONTHLY AFFORDABILITY” cell with goal monthly input and strategy notes
- Congratulatory note appears when goal is met; hides strategy notes
- APR and TERM controls merged into Monthly Payment cell; aligned labels; removed “Months” suffix
- Inline savings next to “Finance Taxes & Fees?” and “Finance Negative Equity?” (faint), instead of a single summary line
- “CASH DUE AT SIGNING” amount moved into the label line

## Trade‑in
- Rename “Trade‑in Value” → “Trade‑in Offer”
- Add optional “Trade‑in Asking Price” and “Asking vs. Offer Delta” (accounting style, color text only)
- Remove “Trade‑in Tax Value” note

## Fees & Inputs
- Dealer Fee presets (desc only); fee rows are responsive
- Currency placeholders standardized to “Enter Amount”
- Removed live typing formatter; values still format on blur
- Inputs flex within rows without overflow

## Mobile & Entry
- Ensure Return/Next key visibility via `enterkeyhint` and `inputmode`
- Pressing Enter saves and focuses the next field (desktop and mobile)

## Limits & Notes
- Affordability APR/TERM note warns when APR ≤ 0 or TERM > 96 months; wraps text within the cell
